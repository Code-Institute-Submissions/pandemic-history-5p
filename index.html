                    From the bubonic plague to Covid-19,  throughout human history there have been and still are many illnesses that have blighted us.

                    Not all outbreaks are epidemics, and not all epidemics are pandemics. Whilst many have blown through countries, few have swept across countries and with the rise in cross-continental trading and travel within the last 200 years (and some cases, even further back) it's easier than ever for diseases to cross borders unchecked and make itself home in the people of the wide world.
