            <h2>Antonine Plague</h2>
            <h3>165AD - 180AD</h3>

            <p>
                Also known as the "Plague of Galan" after the doctor who described it, the Antonine Plague was the first
                known pandemic within the Roman Empire. Occurring during the waning years of the "Pax Romana" a 200 year
                span of time in Roman history seen as a golden age the disease, which is thought to be either smallpox
                or measles, had a fatality rate of 25% and is thought to have killed from 5 to 10 million people.
                <br>
                <br>
                Through the bustle of trade and unclean water, the plague spread across the empire, and for some is
                thought to have heralded the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire. One thing that is certain is
                the loss of life: as many armies, farms, cities and councils were depleted. They were then repopulated
                by Emperor Marcus Aurelius with the ranks of slaves and gladiators for his legions, migrants from
                outside the borders for his farmsteads, a mixture of both for the cities and Councils.

            <p>
                Named after Saint Cyprian, bishop of Carthage. The 'Plague of Cyprian' began in Ethiopia 250CE,
                continuing to Rome and its Empire, and then spreading across Greece and Syria. As with many outbreaks
                and pandemics in ancient times, the identity of the killer will remain forever up for debate, but the
                most likely suspects have been viral hemorrhagic fever such as the Ebola Virus and others like smallpox
                and influenza.
                <br>
                <br>
                With the already ongoing troubles of constant skirmishes and warfare from both the Parthian Empire in
                Mesopotamia and Germanic Tribes invading Gaul, the spread of disease and death was already high. Now
                along with the Plague of Cyprian, flood, famine, drought and the panicked escape of those in the
                countryside to the cities: the Roman Empire almost saw its demise, and to Saint Cyprian, it was as if
                watching the world at its end.

            <h2>Plague of Justinian</h2>
            <h3>541AD - 549AD</h3>

            <p>
                Named after the Byzantine Emperor, the Plague of Justinian was the first outbreak of the three major
                Plague Pandemics. Thought to have been brought to the capital Constantinople by rats on a grain ship
                from Egypt, it is believed that the plague killed 5000 to 10000 people a day, with the death count
                rising so quickly that bodies were stacked in churches and city wall towers. In total 40% of the city's
                people are thought to have died.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although the Plague of Justinian tore across the Byzantine Empire the plague would periodically appear
                across Europe for the next 200 years and then would not re-emerge as a major pandemic until the second
                plague.

            <h2>Leprosy</h2>
            <h3>11th Century - 13th Century</h3>

            <p>
                Now known as "Hansen's Disease" for Gerhard Armauer Hansen's work on it, Leprosy in the 11th century was
                thought to have been spread by trade and the travel of pilgrims and Crusaders.
                <br>
                <br>
                Interestingly enough, Leprosy was first viewed somewhat favourably, as those with it were considered to
                have been experiencing Purgatory on Earth, which lead to it being seen as holy. This meant that those
                who chose to live in leper houses in churches would spend their waning days in prayer, while those who
                did not would be forced to wear bells to inform others of their approach. However, later into the
                medieval era leprosy was seen as a punishment from God for sin, and many were ostracized, with some
                places forcing those into exile and into towns specifically for lepers.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout Europe it is estimated that around 19,000 leper houses had been built to both care for and
                quarantine sufferers, and although in the 14th century leprosy had all but disappeared it persevered in
                Norway until the 19th Century with the final two leprosy patients dying in 1946.

            <h2>Second Black Plague</h2>
            <h3>1347 - 1352</h3>

            <p>
                Although disputed, the origins of the Second Plague are thought to have come from one of two places,
                Crimea or Central Asia, specifically Mongolia as the plague had already been ravaging the country. The
                spread of the plague is less cryptic.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1345, the Mongol leader, Jani Beg, began his second attempt at sieging the port town of Caffa,
                (modern-day Feodosia) in which he would use the bodies of his own soldiers who had succumbed to the
                plague as weapons in his catapults. The resulting spread of the plague throughout Caffa pushed many to
                flee by sea, and these boats carried the plague with them all around Europe.
                <br>
                <br>
                Estimated to have killed 75 to 200 million people from 1346 - 1353, and not including the later sporadic
                outbreaks, the second Black Death caused an incredible amount of death, and at the same time brought a
                great amount of social and economic change for the poor. Those who survived thrived from the small
                workforce due to higher wages and more land to own and work on.

                With the arrival of Christopher Columbus and the later settlement of Europeans, the Natives of the newly
                found continents received many gifts and technologies through trade, and at the same time contracted
                many diseases that their societies and bodies were not prepared for.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most notable of those spread being Smallpox and Influenza. For the Native Americans, the spread of
                Smallpox ended with an estimated death count of 90% destroying their many societies and disrupting
                agriculture, crafts and hunting which gave them products to trade.
                <br>
                <br>
                To the south, the Spanish brought disease, measles, yellow fever etc, that would eat at and destroy the
                Aztec empire, with the 1545-1548 epidemic causing an estimated 5 to 15 million death toll.</p>

                Emerging in India and spreading to many countries, the Third Cholera pandemic is the worst of its
                siblings. Like previous diseases, Cholera travelled across both lines of trade and the transport of
                troops across the British empire.
                <br>
                <br>
                With over 1 million deaths, Russia was deeply wounded by Cholera. It was the same for many other
                countries including England, Wales, France, Puerto Rico, Japan and more. Death counts ranged from tens
                of thousands to hundreds, with some places like Japan and England enduring multiple outbreaks in the
                years leading up to the fourth pandemic.</p>

            <h3>1855 - 1960</h3>

            <p>
                The third and possibly final plague pandemic spread across the world was only considered no longer
                active by the World Health Organization in 1960, when recorded deaths across the world dropped to 200.
                <br>
                <br>
                Like the last two plague pandemics, global trade and ease of travel contributed to its spread, but this
                time the plague had struck in a time of growth for the field of medicine. Vaccines and antibiotics were
                successfully developed to combat it, and as these measures were rolled out across the globe, cases would
                continue falling.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although easily treatable, plague is still an issue in many poorer countries, and in places like the USA
                there are actually 1 to 17 cases per year.

            <p>
                Starting in central asia and ending only a year later, the "Russian Flu", in comparison to others in
                history, was not particularly deadly as 1 million people died in the pandemic while the suspected cases
                are estimated to be between 300 to 900 million.
                <br>
                <br>
                With the first outbreak being Bukhara, Russian Empire and traveling across the railroads and sea, the
                flu had reached all across the Russian Empire, and then into the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway,
                Denmark), German Empire, Spain, France, Great Britain and more.
                <br>
                <br>
                Compared to other pandemics, public knowledge of the Russian Flu was much higher, as coverage in the
                papers happened on a daily basis. Along with explanations, data and facts, those who chose to read the
                paper would be highly informed on the flu before it even reached them.

            <p>
                Although it would be more appropriate to name this pandemic "great influenza epidemic", as it did not
                originate from Spain, the name comes from the fact that its evolution into a global pandemic started in
                the post Great War (WW1) era, and at fear of making themselves look weak and unprepared for future
                countries no one would report on the flu causing chaos through there country, but spain who had been
                neutral for the whole war had no problems with reporting the flu due to its lack of need for keeping up
                a strong appearance.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Spanish Flu's first cases and outbreaks began in the United States within a military camp, and from
                there it moved across the USA, and then across the sea to other American bases in other countries in
                europe.
                <br>
                <br>
                The main spreader of the Flu seemed to have been troops returning home, or those who were being
                stationed abroad, and in the case of Russia, the spread came from the release of Russian POWs from
                Germany who would return home and spread the disease to their families.

                The number of deaths for this Flu is said to be ranging from 25 - 50 million, although from stated
                above, countries may have reported incorrect death counts to keep up appearances and a strong image.

                The first known case was in Southern China, late 1956, with the disease spreading to Hong Kong and then
                onto Singapore, who was the first to report the outbreak to WHO (World Health Organisation) and reaching
                many countries in Europe, Asia and the America's, resulting in a death count of 1 - 4 million.

                <br>
                In the United States and United Kingdom the pandemic had a notable effect on the countries economies,
                which in turn has an effect on its people. Some say that the Influenza had a hand in the 1958 Recession
                in the USA, and in the UK it is believed that 9 million people had contracted the Influenza, and by the
                end of the pandemic the government had spent £10 million on benefits for those affected, but the economy
                was still hit hard as many factories, offices and mines were forced to close.

                A descendant of the previously mentioned Influenza pandemic, the Hong Kong Flu was genetically different
                and a new vaccine had to be developed, which only took 4months and was developed by the same

                <br>
                <br>
                Large outbreaks of this flu appeared in Vietnam, Singapore, India, Philippines, Europe, Australia and

                Even though the world had just gone through a similar pandemic in years prior, governments were still

            <h2>HIV/AIDS</h2>
            <h3>1981 - ongoing</h3>

            <p>
                While the acronyms HIV and AIDS are used interchangeably by some, to put it simply, everyone with AIDS
                has HIV but not everyone who has HIV has AIDS. As a person having HIV leads to AIDS if it is left
                untreated.
                <br>
                <br>
                The disease is thought to have originated in 1920 Republic Of Congo, which at that time was Belgium
                Congo. It is widely accepted to have jumped from Chimpanzee’s and/or Gorillas, and from bushmeat,
                although not from the consumption of bushmeat, HIV can be transmitted by bites and cuts from such
                animals.
                <br>
                <br>
                The travel of HIV from the continent of Africa to other continents and countries mainly came from
                migrants, and its movement within countries can also be attributed to sex traficking.

            <h2>Covid-19</h2>
            <h3>2019 - present</h3>

            <p>
                As the virus is still new and largely unknown, the exact origins are still unknown and debated, COVID-19
                is noted to have a close relation to bat and pangolin coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are actually a group
                of related diseases in mammals and birds and have been around for longer than many people think. An
                earlier pandemic on this page, Russian Flu, is actually thought to be a bovine coronavirus, though this
                is different to the current with no known relation.
